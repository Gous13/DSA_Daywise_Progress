Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: 0

Explanation:

The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

Example 2:

Input: s = "loveleetcode"

Output: 2

Example 3:

Input: s = "aabb"

Output: -1
